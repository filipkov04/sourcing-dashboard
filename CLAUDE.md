# SourceTrack - Sourcing Dashboard

## Project Overview

Web dashboard for fashion/manufacturing brands to track real-time production status from all their factories. Think Shopify for production tracking.

**Repo:** https://github.com/filipkov04/sourcing-dashboard
**Developers:** Filip & Marco | **Timeline:** 12 weeks (currently Week 3 of 8 core + 4 planned)

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Supabase | **ORM:** Prisma 7
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js v5
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 (dark theme default) | **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix)
- **Charts:** Recharts | **DnD:** @dnd-kit | **Export:** html-to-image | **Deployment:** Vercel

## Key Conventions

**API Response Format:**
```typescript
{ success: true, data: {...} }  // or { success: false, error: "message" }
```

**Next.js 16 Route Params** — `params` is a Promise:
```typescript
export async function PATCH(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await params;
}
```

**Theme:** Dark by default (`zinc-900` bg, `zinc-800` cards). Always use `dark:` variants for light mode support. Pattern: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`, `bg-white dark:bg-zinc-800`.

**Stage metadata:** Stored as ordered array `[{key, value}]` (not object — Postgres jsonb doesn't preserve key order).

**Git:** Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

**Prisma:** Always `npx prisma generate` after schema changes, restart dev server.

## Status System

**Order Status** (auto-updated from stages): PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | DELAYED | DISRUPTED | COMPLETED | SHIPPED | DELIVERED | CANCELLED

**Stage Status:** NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | SKIPPED | DELAYED | BLOCKED

Auto-rules: Any BLOCKED stage → order DISRUPTED. Any DELAYED stage → order DELAYED. All COMPLETED/SKIPPED → order COMPLETED. Manual statuses (SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED) are never overwritten.

## Current Status (Session 26 — Mar 1, 2026)

**Last completed:** Animated Count-Up Numbers + Exchange Rate Tooltip Fix

**Session 26 changes (Marco):**
- **Animated Count-Up Numbers:**
  - `components/animated-number.tsx` (NEW): Reusable `<AnimatedNumber>` client component using framer-motion `useSpring`. Animates 0 → value on viewport entry via `useInView` (once). Updates DOM directly via ref (not MotionValue-as-children) to avoid SSR hydration mismatch with Radix `useId()`. Supports custom `formatFn` for decimals. Uses `tabular-nums` to prevent layout shift.
  - `dashboard/_components/dashboard-stats-cards.tsx`: 5 KPI cards (Total, Active, Completed, Delayed, Disrupted) use `<AnimatedNumber>`.
  - `analytics/page.tsx`: `SummaryCard` gained optional `numericValue` + `suffix` props. "Avg Lead Time" and "At Risk" animate; "On Track" (fraction) and "Bottleneck Stage" (text) stay plain.
  - `analytics/_components/stage-duration-chart.tsx`: Per-stage avg duration mini-cards animate.
  - `factories/[id]/page.tsx`: 4 factory detail stat cards (Total Orders, Active, On-Time Rate %, Avg Progress %) animate.
  - `factories/factories-table.tsx`: 4 factory list summary cards (Total Factories, Total Orders, Avg Orders/Factory with decimal formatFn, Idle Factories) animate.
  - `team/page.tsx`: 4 team stat cards (Total Members, Owners, Admins, Members) animate.
  - `orders/[id]/page.tsx`: Order quantity hero card animates.
  - `timeline/page.tsx`: 4 stats strip cards (Total, In Progress, Critical, Done) animate.
- **Exchange Rate Tooltip Fix:**
  - `dashboard/_components/exchange-rate-cards.tsx`: Removed broken `<Tooltip trigger="none" />` from sparkline AreaCharts — was showing raw values on hover despite `trigger="none"` (recharts typing issue). Also removed unused `Tooltip` import.

**Session 25 changes (Filip):**
- **Full Messages Page** — WhatsApp-grade messaging experience at `/messages`:
  - **Schema:** Renamed `manualStatus` → `status` in UserPresence model (APIs already used `status`)
  - **Types:** Added `DIRECT` to ConversationType, `forwardedFromId`/`forwardedFrom`/`pinnedAt` to Message type
  - **Conversations API:** Added DIRECT type support with duplicate DM prevention
  - **Packages:** `@emoji-mart/react`, `@emoji-mart/data`, `wavesurfer.js`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`
  - **5 New API endpoints:**
    - `app/api/conversations/[id]/messages/[messageId]/replies/route.ts` — Thread replies (GET + POST)
    - `app/api/messages/search/route.ts` — Global message search (paginated, org-scoped)
    - `app/api/conversations/[id]/messages/search/route.ts` — In-conversation search
    - `app/api/messages/forward/route.ts` — Forward to multiple conversations
    - `app/api/presence/manual/route.ts` — Manual presence override (PATCH)
  - **3 New hooks:** `lib/use-forward.ts`, `lib/use-voice-recorder.ts`, updated `lib/use-presence.ts`
  - **17 New components in `components/messages/`:**
    - `messages-page.tsx` — Client orchestrator (3-column layout, state management)
    - `conversation-sidebar.tsx` — Filter tabs, presence dots, pinned conversations
    - `chat-header.tsx` — Conversation info, presence, search/settings
    - `message-list.tsx` — Virtualized with @tanstack/react-virtual, auto-scroll, date separators
    - `message-bubble.tsx` — Own/others/system styles, forwarded header, reactions, hover actions
    - `message-input.tsx` — Auto-grow textarea, attachments, emoji, mic, edit mode
    - `date-separator.tsx`, `typing-indicator.tsx`
    - `emoji-picker-popover.tsx` — Lazy-loaded emoji-mart picker
    - `voice-recorder-ui.tsx` — Live waveform, duration timer, cancel/send
    - `voice-message-player.tsx` — wavesurfer.js waveform, play/pause, speed cycle
    - `thread-panel.tsx` — 360px slide-in with replies
    - `search-panel.tsx` — In-conversation + global search
    - `message-context-menu.tsx` — Reply/Edit/Delete/Forward/Pin/Copy
    - `forward-dialog.tsx` — Multi-select target conversations
    - `new-dm-dialog.tsx` — Search team members, create DM
    - `media-lightbox.tsx` — Full-screen image viewer
  - **Navigation:** Added Messages item to sidebar with unread badge
  - **New UI component:** `components/ui/popover.tsx` (Radix Popover)
  - **Stress test:** Updated to 38 endpoints, all passing (100% success rate)
  - Build clean (`npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx next build` pass)

**Session 25 changes (Marco):**
- **Request/Approval Message Cards in Chat:**
  - `app/api/conversations/[id]/route.ts`: Added `request: { select: { id, type, status } }` to Prisma include so conversation detail returns linked request info.
  - `lib/use-conversations.ts`: Added `request: { id: string; type: string; status: string } | null` to `Conversation` type.
  - `components/messages/message-item.tsx`: REQUEST messages render as orange-tinted cards with FileText icon + "View Request" button. APPROVAL messages render as color-coded status cards (green/red/amber for APPROVED/REJECTED/PENDING_INFO) with matching icons + badges. Both link to `/requests?rid=<requestId>` for deep-link.
  - `components/messages/messages-thread.tsx`: Passes `requestId` prop from `conversation.request?.id` to `<MessageItem>`.
- **Request Details Expansion (all statuses):**
  - `app/(dashboard)/requests/page.tsx`: Every request card is now clickable (full header is a `<button>`) to expand/collapse details — not just pending-review requests. Chevron icon always visible. Supports `?rid=` query param to auto-expand + scroll to a specific request on page load.
- **Edit Request Change Filtering:**
  - `app/api/requests/route.ts`: ORDER_EDIT_REQUEST and FACTORY_EDIT_REQUEST creation now compares submitted fields against current entity values. Only actually changed fields are stored in `changes`, and original values are snapshotted in `data._previousValues` for reliable before/after diffs even after approval.
  - `app/(dashboard)/requests/page.tsx` (`EditRequestDetails`): Always fetches live entity to filter unchanged fields from display. Uses `_previousValues` for "Before" column when available. Shows loading placeholder while fetching to prevent layout flash.

**Session 24 changes (Marco):**
- **Task 5.27** — Request-to-Chat Integration:
  - `app/api/requests/route.ts`: POST now auto-creates a SUPPORT conversation after request creation. Participants = requester + all ADMIN/OWNER users. Sends a REQUEST-type message summarising the request. Links `conversationId` back to the request. Non-fatal try/catch so request creation never fails due to chat errors.
  - `app/api/requests/[id]/route.ts`: Added `sendConversationMessage()` helper. Sends messages on three events: (1) requester responds to NEEDS_INFO → TEXT message with response text; (2) admin REJECTS or needs info → APPROVAL message with REJECTED/PENDING_INFO action; (3) admin APPROVES → APPROVAL+APPROVED message inside the same DB transaction.
  - `app/(dashboard)/requests/page.tsx`: Added `conversationId` to `RequestItem` interface. Added "Chat" link button (MessageSquare icon) that appears on any request with a conversationId, linking to `/messages?cid=<id>`.
  - `app/(dashboard)/messages/page.tsx`: Added `useSearchParams` — reads `?cid=` query param and auto-selects that conversation on page load.

**Session 23 changes (Marco):**
- **Task 6.8** — Redis Setup: Upstash Redis connected via ioredis (`lib/redis.ts`, `REDIS_URL` in `.env`)
- **Task 6.9** — BullMQ job queue: `lib/queues/connection.ts`, `lib/queues/integration-queue.ts`, `lib/workers/integration-worker.ts`
- **Task 6.10** — Integration Manager: `Integration` Prisma model added + pushed to DB, `lib/integrations/manager.ts`, `lib/integrations/types.ts`. Also fixed DB connection: `DIRECT_URL` added for Prisma CLI, `DATABASE_URL` uses Transaction mode pooler (port 6543)
- **Task 6.11** — Credential Encryption: AES-256-GCM via Node crypto, `lib/integrations/encryption.ts`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`
- **Task 6.12** — REST Adapter: `lib/integrations/adapters/rest-adapter.ts` with auth (bearer/basic/api_key), field mapping, status mapping, stage sync
- **Task 6.13** — Mock Factory API: `app/api/mock-factory/orders/route.ts` with 5 realistic orders, auth validation, dev-only
- **Task 7.7** — SFTP Adapter: `lib/integrations/adapters/sftp-adapter.ts` with password/private-key auth, CSV/JSON file download
- **Task 7.8** — CSV Parser: `lib/integrations/csv-parser.ts` — RFC 4180 compliant, auto-detects delimiter, handles quoted fields/BOM/Windows line endings, includes `toCsv()` for exports
- **Task 7.9** — Webhook Receiver: `app/api/webhooks/[factoryId]/route.ts` with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, `lib/integrations/adapters/webhook-adapter.ts`
- **Task 7.10** — Data Transformer: `lib/integrations/transformer.ts` — centralised field mapping, status mapping lookup tables, `transformRecords()` + `applyToDb()`. Removed all duplicated mapping code from adapters.
- **Task 7.11** — Sync Scheduler: `app/api/cron/sync-integrations/route.ts` — Vercel Cron every 15 min, per-integration frequency check, enqueues BullMQ jobs

**Next task:** Week 7 PR or Week 8

**Session 22 changes (Marco):**
- **Scroll-Reveal Animations** — Replaced Tailwind `animate-in` classes on dashboard with scroll-triggered framer-motion animations. New reusable `components/scroll-reveal.tsx` client component using `whileInView` + `onViewportEnter`. Adapts animation duration/delay to scroll velocity (fast scroll = near-instant). Staggered child animations for grid sections (cards wave in individually). Viewport trigger at 5% visibility, animates once.

**Session 21 changes (Marco):**
- **Task 5.23** — Request Database Models: `Request` model with `RequestType` and `RequestStatus` enums, relations to User (requester/reviewer), Order, Factory, Conversation. Prisma schema updated.
- **Task 5.24** — Order Request Form: `app/(dashboard)/orders/request/page.tsx` for clients to submit new order requests, `app/(dashboard)/orders/[id]/request-edit/page.tsx` for edit requests with change reasons.
- **Task 5.25** — Factory Request Form: `app/(dashboard)/factories/request/page.tsx` for new factory requests, `app/(dashboard)/factories/[id]/request-edit/page.tsx` for edit requests.
- **Task 5.26** — Request Review UI: Dual-purpose `/requests` page — admins see all requests with approve/reject/request-info controls, non-admins see their own requests with respond panel. Edit request review shows before→after diff table (changed fields only). Full request-info loop: admin requests info → requester responds → back to PENDING. `app/api/requests/[id]/route.ts` (GET/PATCH) with transactional approval execution and error handling for unique constraints/missing records.
- **Task 5.28** — Role-Based Create Buttons: Conditional "Add Order"/"Add Factory" vs "Request Order"/"Request Factory" buttons based on user role across factory and order list/detail pages. Delete request dialog component.
- **Order Deletion** — Added `DELETE /api/orders/[id]` for ADMIN/OWNER with confirmation dialog on order detail page.
- **Auth Resilience** — JWT callback now refreshes `organizationId` and `organizationName` from DB (not just role), wrapped in try/catch for graceful degradation when DB is unavailable.
- **Sidebar** — Added "Requests" nav item (ClipboardList icon) between Team and Settings.

**Previous sessions:**
