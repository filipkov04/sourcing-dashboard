# SourceTrack - Sourcing Dashboard

## Project Overview

Web dashboard for fashion/manufacturing brands to track real-time production status from all their factories. Think Shopify for production tracking.

**Repo:** https://github.com/filipkov04/sourcing-dashboard
**Developers:** Filip & Marco | **Timeline:** 12 weeks (currently Week 3 of 8 core + 4 planned)

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Supabase | **ORM:** Prisma 7
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js v5
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 (dark theme default) | **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix)
- **Charts:** Recharts | **DnD:** @dnd-kit | **Deployment:** Vercel

## Key Conventions

**API Response Format:**
```typescript
{ success: true, data: {...} }  // or { success: false, error: "message" }
```

**Next.js 16 Route Params** — `params` is a Promise:
```typescript
export async function PATCH(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await params;
}
```

**Theme:** Dark by default (`zinc-900` bg, `zinc-800` cards). Always use `dark:` variants for light mode support. Pattern: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`, `bg-white dark:bg-zinc-800`.

**Stage metadata:** Stored as ordered array `[{key, value}]` (not object — Postgres jsonb doesn't preserve key order).

**Git:** Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

**Prisma:** Always `npx prisma generate` after schema changes, restart dev server.

## Status System

**Order Status** (auto-updated from stages): PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | DELAYED | DISRUPTED | COMPLETED | SHIPPED | DELIVERED | CANCELLED

**Stage Status:** NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | SKIPPED | DELAYED | BLOCKED

Auto-rules: Any BLOCKED stage → order DISRUPTED. Any DELAYED stage → order DELAYED. All COMPLETED/SKIPPED → order COMPLETED. Manual statuses (SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED) are never overwritten.

## Current Status (Session 15 — Feb 12, 2026)

**Last completed:** Product image on order page, light mode fixes, pending invitations filter, email normalization, missing type values.

**Next task:** Task 3.6 (Week 3 PR) OR BL-1 (Project Selector) OR Week 4 tasks

**Pending implementations** (ready but not started):
- Timeline redesign plan → `docs/plans/PENDING_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`
- Card enlargement plan → `docs/plans/PENDING_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`
- Project Selector (BL-1) → `.claude/plans/reactive-scribbling-island.md`
